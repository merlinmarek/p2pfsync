p2pfsync (peer to peer file synchronizer) is a command line utility to automatically synchronize files between peers on a local network. All files in the directory ./sync_files relative to the active directory are available to other peers. When p2pfsync discovers a file that is present at another peer this file gets downloaded and added to the sync_files directory. Furthermore, logs are created in the ./logs directory.
